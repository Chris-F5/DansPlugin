This is a minecraft plugin that changes behaviour of bows and crossbows.
By default, arrow spread is dissabled.
To customise bow behaviour add scoreboard objectives `dansplugin_vel` and
`dansplugin_acc`.

`dansplugin_acc` holds a score for each player. The greater this score, the more
arrow spread that players bows and crossbows shoot with. 15 is a resonable value.

`dansplugin_vel` holds a score for each player. A score of 100 does not affect
that players bow velocity. A score greater than 100 increases that players arrow
velocity and a score below 100 reduces that players arrow velocity. 200 doubles
velocity. For some reason changing arrow velocity too much can make the arrows
look like they are not going in the correct direction when in flight but this is
just visual, they will land in the correct position.
